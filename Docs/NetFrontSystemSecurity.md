# NetFront System Security

NetFront uses a role‑based security model designed for youth hockey, high school hockey, and future tournament expansion. This document defines all roles, permissions, access rules, access code behavior, and session security.

# 1. Overview

NetFront separates responsibilities across several roles:

- SuperAdmin
- OrgAdmin
- Team Manager
- Coach
- Game Manager (formerly Scorekeeper)

Game Manager and Stat Manager authenticate using **Access Codes** generated at the team level. Coaches and Team Managers handle day‑to‑day team operations. OrgAdmins oversee the entire organization.
