# NetFront Scoreboard Control Mode Matrix (Printout)

Date: 2026-08-03
Scope: Game Manager Mobile + Gateway integration modes

## 1) Core Ownership Matrix

| Domain | Manual Mode | Clock + Period Sync (current) | Clock Advance Mode (next) | Full Automode (future) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source of truth | Tablet | Scoreboard for clock/period only | Scoreboard for live game-state domains | Tablet for all domains |
| Clock time/start/stop | Tablet | Scoreboard | Scoreboard | Tablet |
| Period number/state | Tablet | Scoreboard | Scoreboard | Tablet |
| Score (home/away) | Tablet | Tablet | Scoreboard | Tablet |
| Shots (home/away) | Tablet | Tablet | Scoreboard | Tablet |
| Penalties slot 1-2 (board-visible) | Tablet | Tablet | Scoreboard | Tablet |
| Penalty overflow (3+) | Tablet | Tablet | Tablet shadow penalties | Tablet |
| Goal attribution (scorer/assists) | Tablet | Tablet | Tablet | Tablet |
| Penalty attribution (player/reason) | Tablet | Tablet | Tablet | Tablet |
| Timeout/horn metadata | Tablet | Usually tablet | Scoreboard if available, else tablet | Tablet |
| Event feed ownership | Tablet | Tablet + clock stamps from scoreboard | Hybrid: scoreboard core events + tablet enrichment | Tablet |
| Primary data flow | Local only | Scoreboard -> Tablet (clock/period) | Scoreboard -> Tablet (clock/period/score/shots/penalties) | Tablet -> Scoreboard |
| Write direction to scoreboard | None | None/read-only | None/read-only (except optional ack) | Yes (commands/state mirror) |
| Operator role during play | Full control | Manage game, clock follows board | Enrich and manage overflow only | Full control from tablet |

## 2) Authority Rules Matrix

| Rule | Manual | Clock+Period | Clock Advance | Full Automode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Can tablet start/stop clock? | Yes | No when connected; local fallback if disconnected | No when connected; local fallback if disconnected | Yes |
| Can tablet change period? | Yes | No when connected | No when connected | Yes |
| Can tablet edit score/shots live? | Yes | Yes | No (unless admin override) | Yes |
| Can tablet edit player attribution? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Can tablet manage overflow penalties? | Yes | Yes | Yes (required) | Yes |

## 3) Connection and Recovery Matrix

| Scenario | Manual | Clock+Period | Clock Advance | Full Automode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gateway disconnect mid-game | No impact | Fall back to local clock if enabled | Fall back to local clock + local score/shots tracking (degraded mode banner) | Continue local authoritative control; queue outbound updates |
| Gateway reconnect | N/A | Resync clock/period from scoreboard | Full resync of scoreboard-owned domains, preserve tablet enrichment | Push tablet state to scoreboard, verify applied |
| Drift detected | N/A | Snap clock to scoreboard | Snap scoreboard-owned domains to scoreboard, keep tablet metadata | Keep tablet values, retry send to scoreboard |
| Auth failure | N/A | Stay local fallback | Stay degraded fallback; block scoreboard-owned edits or require override | Continue tablet authority; alert output failure |

## 4) UI and Operator Matrix

| UI Element | Manual | Clock+Period | Clock Advance | Full Automode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status pill | Manual Clock | Connected/Not Connected | Connected/Not Connected/Degraded | Tablet Control/Output Degraded |
| Ownership banner | Optional | Clock owned by scoreboard | Live game state owned by scoreboard | All game state owned by tablet |
| Disabled controls | None | Clock/period controls when connected | Clock/period/score/shots/penalty slots 1-2 edits when connected | None (except safety locks) |
| Override action | N/A | Use Local Fallback | Use Local Fallback | Force resend to scoreboard |

## 5) Event Handling Matrix (Clock Advance Mode)

| Event Type | Origin | Tablet Action | Persisted As |
|---|---|---|---|
| Goal registered on board | Scoreboard | Create/merge event shell; prompt for scorer/assists | Goal event: source=scoreboard + enrichment=tablet |
| Penalty on board slot 1-2 | Scoreboard | Create penalty shell; add player/reason | Penalty event: source=scoreboard + enrichment=tablet |
| Extra penalty beyond board | Tablet | Create overflow penalty locally | Penalty event: source=tablet_overflow |
| Clock tick/period change | Scoreboard | Apply directly; update timers | Clock timeline: source=scoreboard |
| Manual correction by operator | Tablet | Require reason + audit log | Correction event: source=tablet_override |

## 6) Risk Matrix

| Risk | Highest Impact Mode | Why | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dual-write conflicts | Clock Advance, Full Automode | Two systems writing same domain | Hard domain ownership locks per mode |
| Reconnect divergence | Clock Advance | Board advanced while tablet offline | Deterministic resync handshake + sequence numbers |
| Incomplete board telemetry | Clock Advance | Some controllers do not expose all fields | Capability profile + per-domain fallback |
| Operator confusion | All sync modes | Ownership unclear during stress | Always-visible ownership banner + disabled controls |
| Penalty lifecycle bugs | Clock Advance | Overflow + period transitions | Penalty state machine with carryover rules |
| Output command failure | Full Automode | Board may reject or lose commands | Ack/retry queue + local authority retained |

## 7) Transition Matrix

| From -> To | Allowed During Active Game? | Required Confirmation | Required Sync Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manual -> Clock+Period | Yes | Yes | Pull clock/period from scoreboard |
| Manual -> Clock Advance | Yes | Yes (strong warning) | Pull full scoreboard-owned domains |
| Clock+Period -> Clock Advance | Yes | Yes | Pull score/shots/penalties baseline |
| Clock Advance -> Manual | Yes | Yes | Freeze current state as local authority |
| Clock Advance -> Full Automode | Prefer intermission only | Yes (double confirm) | Push tablet baseline to scoreboard and verify |
| Any -> Full Automode | Prefer pregame/intermission | Yes (double confirm) | Output channel health check + ack test |

## 8) Minimum Safe Operating Rules

1. One mode, one authority per data domain.
2. Never silently switch authority; operator must confirm.
3. On reconnect, run deterministic resync before applying live updates.
4. Show active ownership and connection state at all times.
5. Keep source-tagged audit logs (who/what/when) for corrections.

## 9) Immediate Next Scope (Clock Advance Mode)

1. Enforce edit locks for scoreboard-owned domains while connected.
2. Add degraded fallback banner and behavior when disconnected.
3. Add reconnect resync handshake for scoreboard-owned domains.
4. Implement event shell + enrichment flow for goals and penalties.
5. Keep overflow penalty handling on tablet with clear UI indication.
6. Add source and correction audit fields to event persistence.
